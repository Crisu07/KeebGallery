# Keyboard Gallery
Portfolio that displays all keyboards that I have built that were for personal use or commissioned.

Work in Progress

# To Do
[] Convert styles to a css file to make things cleaner (tutorial did styles in line)
[] Upload all keyboard photos with descriptions
[] Implement buttons to navigate through page
[] Add a review option? Where commissioners can provide feedback for my work
[] Link this page to personal site page
